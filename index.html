        <ul>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li> At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
