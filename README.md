# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation to create this project was to gain a basic knowledge of how to set up a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- I built this project not just to learn the basics of programming, but how to upload my project from Git Bash to GitHub.
- I am currently enrolled in The University of Washingtons coding bootcamp, and building this project helps me be prepared for the upcommming course.
- I learned how a website is built on a basic level, and learned a little bit about loops and arrays which I thought was interesting. It was really cool to see how GitHub works as well, and I can see how useful of a tool it can be.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used to study some of the material I have learned. I can use the DevTools Console to see the JavaScript that is running. I also took specific notes that I thought would be useful, and I believe that learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript will benefit me for my entire career.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
